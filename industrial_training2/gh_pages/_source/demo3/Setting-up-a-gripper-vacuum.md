# Setting up a Gripper - Suction Cup

For this tutorial, we will use a suction cup gripper. In order to control it, we need to toggle a solenoid with a GPIO module. We will use the Acromag 951ELN-4012, but the approach would be similar for a wide variety of Modbus controlled GPIO modules.

Note that this tutorial is more advanced than some of the previous tutorials. While examples and guidelines will be given, the "solution" is not provided. Be sure to refer to the prior tutorials as well as the ROS wiki for more information. Additionally, searching any error messages is always a good way to utilize the vast ROS community knowledgebase.

## Setup Network
* Change the IP address
* Connect to the module using a static IP address such as 128.1.1.2
* Open a browser and enter 128.1.1.100
    * Username: User
	* Password: password00
* Go to network configuration and change the following
    * Static IP: 160.69.69.40
	* Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
	* DNS Server: blank


## Hardware setup
***Important Note:*** These instructions are for a specific setup. Use them only as guidelines. Check your hardware documentation ahead of any attempt. 
### Wire the solenoid valve
The solenoid input needs to be wired to one of the digital outputs of the GPIO module.

### Wire the GPIO module.
This GPIO module needs external power. Wire in a DC source ranging in 15-36V to the DC+ and DC- ports of the GPIO module.

Additionally, the digital outputs need a DC source wired in as well. Wire in a DC source ranging in 5.5-35V to the EXC+ and RTN ports of the gpio module. 

## Make Modbus interface
The GPIO module being used for this tutorial communicates using Modbus. While this tutorial will not cover the details of Modbus, we can use ROS to communicate with it without an in-depth knowledge of Modbus.

### Clone the Modbus package into your workspace

```
git clone https://github.com/HumaRobotics/modbus.git
```

### Create Modbus Interface node
Next we need to create the node that will send the commands to the GPIO module. This is simply modified from the example given in the package cloned above. To do this, create a python node in the pick_and_place/src directory (`touch my_node.py`). Make sure that it is executable (either using `chmod +x filename` or by right-clicking on the file)

Next, copy in the code below. Note that the registers are from the documentation of this module.

        rospy.sleep(0.1)

```

### Create C++ Example
Next we will create a C++ example. First we need to add an executable to the CMakeLists.txt

```
add_executable(gpio_interface_node src/gpio_interface_node.cpp)
target_link_libraries(gpio_interface_node ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
```

Now create the gpio_interface_node.cpp file in the location specified in the CMakeLists.txt


```
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <std_msgs/Int32MultiArray.h>

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "test_gpio");
  ros::NodeHandle nh;

  ros::Publisher modbus_pub = nh.advertise<std_msgs::Int32MultiArray>("modbus_wrapper/output", 1000);

  std_msgs::Int32MultiArray msg;
  while( ros::ok())
  {
    // Set all IO to active (high) 0b111111
    std::vector<int> all_active = {63};
    msg.data = all_active;
    modbus_pub.publish(msg);
    ros::Duration(1.0).sleep();

    // Set all IO to inactive (low) 0b000000
    std::vector<int> all_inactive = {0};
    msg.data = all_inactive;
    modbus_pub.publish(msg);
    ros::Duration(1.0).sleep();

    // Set some IO active - some inactive 0b000111
    std::vector<int> half_active = {7};
    msg.data = half_active;
    modbus_pub.publish(msg);
    ros::Duration(1.0).sleep();
  }

  //exit
  return 0;
}
```

### Test Example
To test this example, first start a roscore and the Python modbus interface node. Then start the C++ example. Verify that it is working - switching the IO on and off every second. If the solenoid is wired correctly, you will likely be able to hear it triggering. 

You can now take this code and add it to `test_bed_core_node.cpp` at appropriate times in order to pick and place the box. While some headers should go to the top, the majority of the code should go within the execution section at the bottom. Look for:
```
// Put gripper code here
// End gripper code here
```
